Hotel Management System

I own a Multi-storey floor that can hold up to 'n' number of rooms at any given point in time. Each room is given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one. i want to create an automated booming system that allows my customers to use my floor room book without human intervention.


Expected Functionalities:

create a floor for a given number of rooms. you can assume: a. User has marked physical room in order of distance - taking in account parking level/room reachability etc. b. All rooms are equal and any room can go in any level.

Book a room 
	a. input data is adhaar registration number and customer name of rooom. 
	b. allots the nearest room depending upon availability.

Vacated a room a. Input data is room number to be freed
